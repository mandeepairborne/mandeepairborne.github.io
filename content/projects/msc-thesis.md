### 📝 Abstract

The exotic pentaquark baryon Θ⁺ (quark content: uudds̄) was investigated theoretically using the **chiral SU(3) quark mean field model** to study its in-medium behavior in dense nuclear and strange matter.

Key observations include:

- A significant decrease in the effective mass of Θ⁺ with increasing baryon density  
- Stronger medium modification in strange matter compared to nuclear matter  
- Nontrivial dependence on isospin asymmetry and temperature  
- Possible existence of Θ⁺ in the hyperonic cores of neutron stars

These results provide insights into **chiral symmetry restoration** in dense QCD matter and support the possibility of **exotic phases** inside compact astrophysical objects.

### 📌 Key Findings

- **Mass reduction:** The effective mass of Θ⁺ drops sharply with increasing baryon density, more significantly in strange matter than in nuclear matter.
- **Thermal and isospin effects:** Isospin asymmetry accelerates the mass drop. Temperature tends to slightly increase Θ⁺ mass at fixed density.
- **Astrophysical relevance:** The findings suggest Θ⁺ may exist in the cores of neutron stars, supporting possible chiral symmetry restoration and exotic hadronic phases.
